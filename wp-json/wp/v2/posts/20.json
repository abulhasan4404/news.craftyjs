&#8216;Bangabandhu&#8217;s deal frees Sheikh Hasina&#8217;"},"content":{"rendered":"\n<p>The total land of Bangladesh and India in 162 enclaves is 24 thousand 270.83 acres.&nbsp;Among them, the area of \u200b\u200b51 enclaves of Bangladesh inside India is seven thousand 110.20 acres and the area of \u200b\u200b111 enclaves of India inside Bangladesh is 17 thousand 158.5 acres.Due to political turmoil, the people living in these lands were unknowingly imprisoned in the prison called Chitmahal.&nbsp;The people here have had to spend 68 years without trial.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The &#8216;Landboundary Agreement&#8217; of 1974 was supposed to solve the enclave problem.&nbsp;The emancipation of the enclave lay in the implementation of this agreement.&nbsp;In 1974 Bangabandhu duly ratified the agreement in our parliament.&nbsp;As a result, there is no legal obstacle to solve it from our side.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>But a section in Bangladesh is very vocal against the agreement.&nbsp;They vigorously campaigned against the Mujib-Indira Pact of 1974 and selling the country.&nbsp;They also continued to speak of the covenant of slavery.&nbsp;Taking this agreement, the special circle continued to press against Bangabandhu.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Behind them was the strong support of the defeated anti-independence forces.&nbsp;They usurped the power of the state after killing Bangabandhu.&nbsp;To stay in power, they fought against the dead Bangabandhu and India, the other party to the agreement.&nbsp;He started giving speeches against the agreement in the field and in the meetings and gatherings.&nbsp;They downgraded India from friend to enemy.<br>Many countries including Pakistan, China, Saudi Arabia became their friends in this work.&nbsp;Not only that, the ideological goals of the liberation war are also getting out of hand gradually.<br>Bangabandhu was banned from BTV for 21 years after his assassination in 1975.&nbsp;There was an attempt to portray India as an aggressor state.&nbsp;Until 1996, without mentioning the name of Pakistan, the enemy of the liberation war, on Victory Day and Independence Day, they loudly called it the invasion force.&nbsp;They did not say which state was the aggressor in the war of liberation.&nbsp;This is what happened.&nbsp;A solvable humanitarian issue stuck in the enclave.&nbsp;Neighboring states lose interest.&nbsp;They did not raise the issue in their parliament.&nbsp;As a result, the exchange stopped altogether.&nbsp;As a result, confinement in the enclave was prolonged.&nbsp;The life from which the release was made on 31 July 2015 at 12:01 PM.&nbsp;As on 1 August 2015.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This August, Bangabandhu was martyred at the hands of the opposing forces in exchange of enclaves.&nbsp;At the beginning of that month, Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina and Narendra Modi&#8217;s government released people by exchanging enclaves.&nbsp;After the abolition of the enclave, as there is a chance to breathe freely, it is also indicated to live with dignity as a human being.&nbsp;We are more or less aware of the sufferings of the people in the enclaves, but their progress after liberation is not much discussed.&nbsp;Words of joy and progress do not appear in the media to the extent that words of pain dominate the media.&nbsp;The development that has taken place in the defunct enclave in the last eight years is remarkable.&nbsp;Envious even of mainlanders.&nbsp;Today the citizens there have come under all civil rights.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>But before the exchange of enclaves, let alone civil rights, there was no freedom to live as a human being.&nbsp;There were no important institutions like mosques, temples, educational institutions, medical services.&nbsp;There was no paved road, no electricity.&nbsp;Even defecating in a paved toilet was unimaginable.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The enclave was a dark world.&nbsp;The state has sovereignty over every inch of land, the citizens are in control of the state.&nbsp;It was not so enclave.&nbsp;There the state had no access to civil life except in the light and air of nature.&nbsp;As a result, they become sanctuaries for criminals.&nbsp;There were no human crimes on land that did not occur in the enclave.&nbsp;If citizens do not commit crimes, criminals from outside states force them to do so.&nbsp;The innocent enclave had no chance of resistance.&nbsp;There was danger in protesting.&nbsp;As a result, they had to compromise.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>As the enclaves were not governed by any Bangladesh-Indian state administration, there was a lot of crime.&nbsp;It has been used as a landing station for human trafficking, gold, motorcycle smuggling in addition to gambling, drug trafficking.&nbsp;In the afternoon, drug addicts used to come there in search of various drugs including Phencidil.&nbsp;There was no trial for murder.&nbsp;The girl was taken away and there was no trial.&nbsp;The land was expropriated and there was no trial.&nbsp;Concealing the real identity of their children, they have provided education in the name of someone from Bangladesh or India.&nbsp;got married&nbsp;The one whose name is in the school register is not his father.&nbsp;Such examples are numerous.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Today the people of that enclave are getting justice.&nbsp;He can get admission in the school in the name of his parents.&nbsp;can grow&nbsp;Landlords are able to buy and sell.&nbsp;Land has been recorded, own name has been established.&nbsp;Bangladesh government has built many government primary schools to develop education in enclaves.&nbsp;There is a new paved building.&nbsp;Rajmahal High School was established in the defunct Garati enclave.&nbsp;The work of construction of four-storey building with government allocation is going on.&nbsp;Saima Wazed Doll Autism School has been established there.&nbsp;Meanwhile, Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman Alim Madrasa has been made official.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Educational institutions are also being set up in Panchagarh&#8217;s Balapara Khagrabari, Beoladanga and Dahala Khagrabari enclaves.&nbsp;In the meantime, two secondary schools have also been made public\u2014Bangamata Sheikh Fazilatun Nesha High School and Sheikh Russell High School.&nbsp;The leaders of the Chitmahal movement established several schools for the spread of education, among which Mofizar Rahman College in Garati and Mainul-Mustafa College in Dashiarchhara.&nbsp;In addition to this, more than a hundred educational institutions including madrasas have been formed.&nbsp;Beautiful mosques, temples, martyrs minar have been built.&nbsp;Two new Vishnu temples have been built at Garati.&nbsp;100% electrification.&nbsp;Clean water has been provided.&nbsp;Honorable Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina has also constructed half-baked houses for the homeless there.&nbsp;98 houses have been handed over in one go.&nbsp;There are 40 more houses allotted.&nbsp;IT Centers, Bank-Insurance Institutions,&nbsp;Police outpost has been opened.&nbsp;According to the 2021 calculations, 22 citizens have joined the BGB service from the enclaves of Panchagarh alone.&nbsp;Students are getting the opportunity to study in the university.&nbsp;Not only that, they are also getting quota for admission.&nbsp;Mahmudul Hasan, son of Golam Mostafa, the leader of Chitmahal Movement, Dashiarchhara, has got the opportunity to study in Dhaka and Rajshahi Universities after completing his studies at Rangpur Cadet College.&nbsp;Instead of being admitted in Dhaka, he was admitted in Rajshahi University in law.&nbsp;Job opportunities have been given to those who obtained degrees from Bangladesh by hiding their identities.&nbsp;Special importance is being given to technology education in Bangladesh.&nbsp;ICT buildings have been set up in many enclaves so that the defunct enclaves also get the same benefits.&nbsp;There training programs are being conducted to create technical manpower.&nbsp;Two ICT buildings have been set up in Rangpur division.&nbsp;One of these is at Garati in Panchagarh,&nbsp;The other is in Dashyarchara of Kurigram.&nbsp;There has been a huge change in the communication system.&nbsp;So much has changed that 27 km of roads have been paved in the defunct enclave of Panchagarh alone.&nbsp;There are 12 big bridges on those roads.&nbsp;There have also been numerous small culverts.&nbsp;Same picture in Dashyarchara.&nbsp;There is a big bridge over the Neelkamal river.&nbsp;Entering Dashyarchara now feels like you have entered a model city.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Many community clinics have been established in enclaves to improve health care.&nbsp;They can get treatment all over the country.&nbsp;Enclaves are covered under the social security program of the state.&nbsp;All allowances including pregnant women&#8217;s nutritional allowance, elderly allowance, widow allowance, child allowance, disabled allowance have now been introduced in the enclaves.&nbsp;Rather, these programs are running in enclaves with more importance than many places.&nbsp;Almost 100% of households are covered by some social security program.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>There are five freedom fighters in the enclaves of Panchagarh, who participated in the great liberation war of 1971.&nbsp;The freedom fighters of Bangladesh got allowance but before the exchange of enclaves they did not get any allowance.&nbsp;Now they have also come under freedom fighter allowance.&nbsp;Even though their land was not independent, they were active fighters in Bangladesh&#8217;s independence war.&nbsp;I request the concerned people to consider the liberation movement of the enclave.&nbsp;The enclave citizens&#8217; diagnosis was correct.&nbsp;Realizing the truth, they composed the slogan of the procession &#8216;Mukti in the hands of Bangabandhu and Sheikh Hasina&#8217;.&nbsp;I look at the current changes and say the enclave is back from hell to heaven.&nbsp;Sheikh Hasina and Narendra Modi would have received the Nobel Peace Prize because of the peaceful resolution of the enclave if the Nobel donors did not have cataracts.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>The total land of Bangladesh and India in 162 enclaves is 24 thousand 270.83 acres.&nbsp;Among them, the area of \u200b\u200b51 enclaves
